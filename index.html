// Instructions

From scratch, build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side. Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:

As a coding bootcamp student
I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:



Play proceeds as follows:


The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.
Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.


Your application should also be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
Refer to the animated GIF below for a demonstration of the application functionality.





Hints


Store your questions as an array of objects in a separate file, questions.js, that follows this format:


var questions = [
  {
    title: "Commonly used data types DO NOT include:",
    choices: ["strings", "booleans", "alerts", "numbers"],
    answer: "alerts"
  },
  {
    title: "The condition in an if / else statement is enclosed within ____.",
    choices: ["quotes", "curly brackets", "parentheses", "square brackets"],
    answer: "parentheses"
  },
  ///etc.
];

The length of the array in questions.js determines the length of play. Fifteen seconds per question is a good estimate, so 5 questions will result in a length of play of 75 seconds.
